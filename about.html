        <p>
          Most of my career as a software dev has been devoted to cloud
          migration. For a developer at a large company, this trained me to
          function as a jack-of-all-trades. I know enough about database
          organization and SQL to implement secure ETL and quering solutions; I
          have a strong web-dev background that allows me work comfortably in
          React, Angular, Vue, or Svelte codebases; I have a solid understanding
          of API layers, business logic, infrastructure-as-code, and AWS cloud
          services. And since my team's software accesses live data including
          protected health information, I'm well versed in cloud security and
          zero-trust authentication and authorization services, including those
          offered by Hashiorp, Azure, and AWS.

          I like to play with my Rasperry Pi, using it as a node in my home
          network to experiment with network traffic and low-level protocols.

        <p>
          In college I worked as a Resident Assistant. Public speaking,
          interpersonal communication, and conflict mediation are a few skills
          that I honed through this experience. I also served as a paid physics
          tutor, which prepared me in my professional career to mentor new
          engineers as my team expanded.

        <h1 class="text-center">Graduate School</h1>
        <p>
          After graduating (Summa Cum Laude) with my bachelors in computer
          science, I decided to go back to SIUE for graduate school. SIUE offers
          an accelerated masters program for computer science, which I
          participated in for two years. I wrote a research article that was
          published and presented at the 43rd Annual International Conference of
          the IEEE Engineering in Medicine & Biology Society (EMBC). However, I
          decided to start my career without finishing my MS requirements.
